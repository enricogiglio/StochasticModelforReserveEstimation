# StochasticModelforReserveEstimation
This repository contains a comprehensive methodology for stochastic reserve estimation in power systems, applied to South Africa's 2050 grid. The Python code simulates reserve requirements, considering tripping events, load uncertainties, renewable energy variability, and ramp dynamincs following ENTSO-E guidelines.
